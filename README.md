# Predicting Car Accident Severity
AI project for Hanyang ITE3051

Group Members: Gavin Pryor, Randy Fu, Fatima Zahra El Bajdali, Marwa Errahmani

Or project intends to investigate the factors in a car accident and predict the severity of the accident. Specifically, we want to highlight which factors have the greatest impact on severity and have an AI model predict how severe an accident is based on those factors. We intend to explore different AI/ML techniques and see which one, if any, performs the best for this type of problem. We intend to use the Kaggle dataset Car Accident Dataset.
