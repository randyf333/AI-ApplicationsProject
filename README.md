Our project intends to investigate the factors in a car accident and predict the severity of the accident using real world data and deep learning techniques. Specifically, we want to highlight which factors have the greatest impact on severity and have an AI model predict how severe an accident is based on those factors. This can later be integrated into a type of alert system, where alerts can be sent to would-be drivers warning them of the road conditions and how severe an accident could be if they get into one. We intend to train a neural network model capable of classifying accident severity into multiple levels (minor, moderate, or severe).  We will use a dataset from Kaggle, which contains detailed records of traffic incidents across the United States. The dataset includes factors such as weather conditions, temperature, visibility, time of day, and road type all of which may influence accident outcomes.
