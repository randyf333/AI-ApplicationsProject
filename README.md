Or project intends to investigate the factors in a car accident and predict the severity of the accident. Specifically, we want to highlight which factors have the greatest impact on severity and have an AI model predict how severe an accident is based on those factors. We intend to explore a nerual network to do the predictions. Our data comes from the Kaggle dataset
